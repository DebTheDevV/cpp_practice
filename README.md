# C++ Practice Vault ğŸš€

Welcome to my C++ learning vault!  
This repository contains my personal C++ practice, including lecture notes, hands-on examples, and problem-solving sessions.

## ğŸ“‚ Structure
## ğŸ§  What Iâ€™m Learning

- Basic syntax and structure of C++
- Data types, variables, and input/output
- Conditionals, loops, and functions (coming up)
- Practice based on the Apna College C++ course

## ğŸ“Œ Notes

- This is a solo learning repo â€” meant to track my growth, not perfection ğŸ˜„
- `a.out` is an auto-generated compiled file (will be ignored later)

## âœ… Next Goals

- Build small programs for each topic
- Start solving basic C++ problems on LeetCode or GFG
- Make my commits more descriptive
